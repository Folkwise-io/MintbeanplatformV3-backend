## Installation

```sh
$ yarn install
```

## Development

Local development and tests are configured to use PostgreSQL in a Docker container.

_[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) must be installed and running for any development work._

### Setting up the local database

1. Start the PostgreSQL container with `yarn postgres`. Development roles and databases are automatically created on the initial run.

2. Run `cp .env.development .env` to use default development database variables during development.

3. Run `yarn pristine`, which resets the database and runs the migrations and seeds.
   **Warning: all existing data in the database will be lost!**

- Access the PostgreSQL CLI with `yarn psql`. All column names that are in camelCase need double quotation marks when used in raw SQL queries (i.e. `SELECT body, "userId" from posts;`).

### Development workflow

1. [Setting up the local database](#setting-up-the-local-database)
2. Run `yarn dev` to start a GraphQL endpoint at `localhost:4000/graphql`.
3. Go to `localhost:4000/graphql` to use the GraphQL Playground.

#### Auto-generating TypeScript types

Running `yarn gen-types` auto-generates a TypeScript definition file using `graphql-codegen`. The tool reads the schema file in `./src/graphql/schema.ts` and outputs TypeScript definitions in `./src/graphql/generated/tsTypes.d.ts`. You may then import types directly from that file, such as:

```ts
import { User } from "./generated/tsTypes";
```

Resolvers are also automatically typed, i.e:

```ts
import { Resolvers } from "../generated/tsTypes";

const postResolver: Resolvers = {
  Query: {
    // Rest of code
  },
};
```

Remember to run `yarn gen-types` after every schema change, to ensure `tsTypes` is up to date and you don't get TS errors. This is unnecessary if you're in hot-reload/watch mode with `yarn dev`, as the generator tool automatically watches for schema changes.

#### Adding new schemas

1. Create the new typeDef file for the entity in `./src/graphql/typedefs/entity.ts`.
2. Run `yarn gen-types` to update the `Resolvers` type in Typescript type so you can take advantage of typing when making the resolver.
3. Create a new resolver file for the entity in `./src/graphql/resolvers/entityResolver.ts`.
4. Add the typedef and resolver into the corresponding array of the schema generator file in `./src/graphql/schema.ts`.

### Running tests / TDD workflow

1. Start the PostgreSQL container with `yarn postgres`. Test roles and databases are automatically created on the initial run.

2. Run `yarn pristine` to set up the test database migrations.

3. Run `yarn test` for a single test with coverage report, or `yarn tdd` to run tests in watch mode as part of a TDD workflow.
